			content="Daniel Dee was born in 1982 in Rome,
		Italy. He started his career as a DJ at the age of 15 working at a famous
		club in Rome: NRG (of Ciampino). At that time, the Roman best club scene was
		dominated by the trance-progressive club genre which influenced him greatly.
		After his first year of performing, he was chosen as the resident DJ of the
		NRG club becoming one of the most important figures of the best Sunday
		evening in Italy. In 1998, he was played regularly on 'future zone' on Mondo
		Radio which was considered at the time the best progressive house radio show
		of the center region of Italy. It was on air every Sunday morning from 12 am
		to 01 pm. As time went by widening his musical knowledge, he played
		techno/progressive and started to work in music studios creating new
		original tracks which at the moment have been released on various records.
		Among these is the historical Bonzai Records. At the same time, he continued
		to gain experience in studios and playing in clubs, working with other top
		DJs of Italy. Most recently, Daniel Dee has put together original and
		innovative projects like: 'The Club' and 'Khoema', which are currently being
		proposed to the Roman club scene." />
